# Discord bot

### Setup
Clone the repository to the location of your choice.
Create the following three files:
- `api_key.txt` should contain the api key for [RIOT games api](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
- `bot_token.txt` should contain your bot token taken from the [discord api](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- `guild_id.txt` should contain the id of the server where you want the bot to be used. To find the guild id of your server check the explanation on this [link](https://poshbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/backends/setup-discord-backend/#find-your-guild-id-server-id).

Next execute `setup.bat` to setup a virtual environment and install dependencies.

Finally to run the bot, execute `run.bat`.
